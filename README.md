# Astronomer Detailed Example DAGs and Concepts
We have made it our business to know the ins and outs of Airflow. Once you get outside of the basic features some things may not be obvious, so we want to share our experiences and expertise with you.

Here you can find a examples and documentation of those examples so that you can move past speed bumps a little faster and get back to automating your workflows.
